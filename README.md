**An AI-driven adaptive onboarding engine that parses your resume,
identifies exact skill gaps against any job description, and generates
a personalized learning roadmap — powered by Groq + Llama-3 and O\*NET.**

## The Problem

Corporate onboarding is broken. Every new hire — whether a fresher
or a 5-year veteran — receives the same generic training curriculum.
Experienced hires waste time on concepts they already know.
Beginners get overwhelmed by advanced content.
Neither reaches productivity efficiently.

## Our Solution

SkillPath AI analyzes each hire's resume against their target job
description, mathematically identifies the exact skill gaps, and
generates a personalized step-by-step learning roadmap — unique
to every individual.

---

## What Makes Us Different

### Explainable AI (XAI) via TraceLogger
Most AI apps output answers without explanation. SkillPath AI
outputs every recommendation with full mathematical and semantic
reasoning. The frontend renders a Reasoning Panel showing exactly
WHY each course was recommended — down to the O*NET importance
weight that triggered it.

### O\*NET Standardization
Raw skill matching fails silently — "NLP" and "Natural Language
Processing" and "Text Analysis" are the same skill but a string
match would miss this entirely. We ground all extraction to the
O*NET database, ensuring apples-to-apples comparison across
every resume and job description.

### Graph-Based Adaptive Pathing
We treat skill acquisition as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
rather than a flat list. Topological sort ensures prerequisites
are always taught before advanced concepts. The shortest path
through the DAG = minimum time to role readiness.

## Features

- **Resume Analysis** — Parses PDF and DOCX resumes to extract
  skills with confidence scores 0-100
- **Skill Gap Analysis** — Computes `gap_score = role_level −
  candidate_level`, weighted by O*NET importance
- **Adaptive Pathway Generation** — DAG-based topological sort
  produces an ordered learning curriculum
- **Reasoning Trace** — Every recommendation explained with
  mathematical justification via TraceLogger
- **Interactive Skill Graph** — Visualizes skill dependencies
  and learning path in real time
- **PDF Export** — Download your personalized roadmap as PDF
- **Cross-Domain Support** — Works for Technical and
  Operational roles

### Gap Scoring Algorithm
```
gap_score      = role_required_level - candidate_level
priority_score = gap_score × onet_importance_weight
coverage_score = matched_skills / total_required_skills
```
